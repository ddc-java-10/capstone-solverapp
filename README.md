# Project proposal starter repository

## Steps

Create a project proposal (for a standalone Android project, capstone project, etc.) in this repository, as follows:

1. In the GitHub **Settings** screen for this repository, enable GitHub Pages by selecting **master branch `/docs` folder** from the **Source** pull-down in the **GitHub Pages** section.

    After making this change, a URL will appear at the top of the **GitHub Pages** section, after the text "Your is ready to be published at", or "Your site is published at"; this is the URL of the GitHub Pages site created from your repository.

2. Clone this repository to your local system.

3. In your local clone of the repository, edit `docs/_config.yml`, replacing the default values of the `author.name` and `author.href` properties with your name and a suitable URL (e.g. your GitHub profile page). Please preserve the formatting of this file, and the quotes around the values of the 2 modified properties. 

3. In your local clone of the repository, edit `docs/index.md` with the content of your proposal. 

    * Edit the `title` and `description` properties in the _front matter_ (the lines at the top, between the 2 lines that contain just 3 dashes each) to make them specific to your proposal.
    
    * Edit the Markdown content of the document to replace the instructions and sample content with content relevant to your project proposal.

4. Commit your changes and push them to GitHub.

5. Review the GitHub Pages site created from your repository (via the URL referenced in step 1), and repeat steps 3 &amp; 4, as necessary.
